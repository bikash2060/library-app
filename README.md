# Library Web Application
This Library Web Application allows users to buy books, search for titles, update their profiles, and view their order history. Administrators have access to a comprehensive panel where they can perform CRUD operations such as adding, deleting, updating, and viewing books. Additionally, admins can monitor total orders and manage the overall system efficiently.
